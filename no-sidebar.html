										<h2><i>The meaning of life is to give life meaning.</i> - Viktor Frankl</h2>
									</header>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>My Ethos</h3>
									<p>I believe each of us of us is here with a purpose, and by living that purpose
									not only will we each experience greater happiness and fulfilment, but we'll also
									be making this earth a better place to live. Knowing that there is a meaning to 
									one's existence, and a purpose for what one does are the essential ingredients
									of motivation, and motivation is the fuel that drives success.</p>
									<p>When we ask ourselves "what is the meaning of my life?" Or, "what is my purpose here?" 
									The answer will not be found in searching for what we can get for ourselves, but rather
									in how we can serve others. Therefore, the question to ask when building
									a career doing what you love is "how can I use my skills and passions to serve others?"</p>
									<p>If we are feeling stuck in life, it's only because our thinking is stuck: our thoughts
									create our experience. In them lies the creative power to shift our experience to anything
									that we put our focus on. What is that you want to show up in your life? What is it that you
									a strong, impossible to ignore, urge to do or be? How does your desire fit in to the bigger
									picture and help others? Focus on that goal and go after it.</p>
									<h3>My backgound</h3>
									<p>My interest in self-development started in my late teens when I could no longer tolerate
									the incessant cycling of negative thoughts. I was convinced that everyone was judging me critically
									and had an often fraught relationship with family members. At that point I picked up a book by
									Louise Hay that was on our shelves., and read her words on affirmations. She explained that it is
									possible to heal one's life by healing one's thoughts. I decided to give it a go and wrote down
									a list of affirmations that I would conciously repeat to myself as a way of breaking the existing
									pattern of thoughts. After a few weeks I noticed things were improving in my relationships and how
									I felt because I had taken off the "dark glasses" of negativity.</p>
									<p>This experience set me on a journey of exploration to learn more about how our thought, beliefs
									and philosophical outlook can be fine tuned to bring about the highest and best experience of life
									that each of us are capable of.</p>
									<p>I believe that developing mastery over our minds is the path to realising our potential, making
									a positive impact on the world and creating the lives we desire.
									<h3>My story</h3>
									<p>Music has been close to my heart from as early as I can remember and this led me to doing a music 
									degree. A bad experience in first year knocked my confidence and so I dropped performance in favour 
									of academic modules that I enjoyed. However, after completing an MA in Ethnomusicology, I realised I 
									missed making music with others. I decided to continue violin and piano studies and accepted an
									invitation to join a community Baroque Orchestra. </p>
