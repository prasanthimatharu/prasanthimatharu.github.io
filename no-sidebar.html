										<h2><i>The meaning of life is to give life meaning.</i> - Viktor Frankl</h2>
									</header>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>My Ethos</h3>
									<p>I believe each of us of us is here with a purpose, and by living that purpose
									not only will we each experience greater happiness and fulfilment, but we'll also
									be making this earth a better place to live. Knowing that there is a meaning to 
									one's existence, and a purpose for what one does are the essential ingredients
									of motivation, and motivation is the fuel that drives success.</p>
									<p>When we ask ourselves "what is the meaning of my life?" Or, "what is my purpose here?" 
									The answer will not be found in searching for what we can get for ourselves, but rather
									in how we can serve others. Therefore, the question to ask when building
									a career doing what you love is "how can I use my skills and passions to serve others?"</p>
									<p>If we are feeling stuck in life, it's only because our thinking is stuck: our thoughts
									create our experience. In them lies the creative power to shift our experience to anything
									that we put our focus on. What is that you want to show up in your life? What is it that you
									a strong, impossible to ignore, urge to do or be? How does your desire fit in to the bigger
									picture and help others? Focus on that goal and go after it.</p>
									<h3>My backgound</h3>
									<p>My interest in self-development started in my late teens when I could no longer tolerate
									the incessant cycling of negative thoughts. I was convinced that everyone was judging me critically
									and had an often fraught relationship with family members. At that point I picked up Louise Hay's book "You Can Heal You Life,"									Louise Hay, and read her words on affirmations. She explained that it is
									and decided to try the strategies she descibed. Her idea is that the basis for all healing is love.
								        Our self talk can be shifted to reflect kindness, gentleness and the kinds of experiences we want to show 
									up in our lives. What we focus on, we create. This shift in perspective created a ripple effect that 
								        was most noticable in the quality of interactions I had with others.</p>
									<p>This experience was pivotal for setting me on a life-long journey to learn how our thoughts, beliefs
									and philosophical outlook can be fine tuned to bring about the highest and best experience of life
									that each of us are capable of. What I've learnt to date is that when we take responsibility over our lives
									we become concious creators. If we see ourselves as victims, we have chosen to cast ourselves as powerless 
								        in the drama of life. It's matter of perspective.</p>
									<p>This is where coaching offers the most poigniant and powerful intervention for supporting and guiding clients to
									from and new and empowered perspective, all the opportunities that are available at any given moment. I believe that developing mastery over our minds is the path to realising our potential, making
									a positive impact on the world and creating the lives we desire. As a coach, my aim is to help you
								        fast track this journey by raising your awareness to see not only what's holding you back, but also, what's possible when
									you have the courage to change your thought and go beyond your comfort zone.</p>
