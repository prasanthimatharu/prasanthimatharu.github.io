											<h3>What students and parents say:</h3>
											<p>"Prasanthi is an exceptional piano teacher who truly understands each student's unique learning style. 
											Her patient approach and clear explanations helped my daughter progress from a complete beginner to playing 
											beautiful pieces within just a few months. Highly recommended!" - Sarah K </p>
											<p>"As an adult beginner, I was nervous about learning violin, but Prasanthi made the experience 
											enjoyable and encouraging. Her teaching methods are excellent, and I now play pieces I never thought 
											possible. The confidence she instilled in me has been life-changing." - Michael M </p>
											 <p>"I can't speak highly enough of Prasanthi's teaching. She helped my son develop proper piano technique 
											    while keeping lessons fun and engaging. Her dedication to each student's progress is remarkable, and 
											    she always finds creative ways to overcome challenges. 
											    100% would recommend to anyone considering music lessons." - Priya H </p>
											<p>"After struggling with other violin teachers, I found Prasanthi, and what a difference! Her approach 
											    is both nurturing and challenging. She helped me break through technical barriers I'd been facing for years.
											    My love for music has been completely rekindled thanks to her expert guidance and encouragement." - Emma B</p>

						    					<p></p>
						    					    <p>"The goals in my coaching sessions were to perform some challenging music and 
												also to put the joy back into playing music... Prasanthi  guided me with some simple
												yet profound question which allowed me to look at why, how and when music had lost 
												its sparkle. Many of the decisions I made came through these discussions and applied
												not only to music but to my life in general. I... realised that summer that hours of 
												practice seemed like minutes because it felt as if I was discovering music for the 
												first time. Thank you Prasanthi for bringing the joy of music back into my life." - Amy T</p>
						    					    <p>"I speak from experience when I say that Prasanthi is a brilliant coach. 
											    She was extremely commited to helping me achieve the goals I wanted. She was able 
											    to encourage me to finding the answers myself, and at the same time was able to 
											    guide me confidently during that process. 
											    100% I would recommend Prasanthi to anyone considering coaching." - Paresh H </p>
											    <p>"Prasanthi provides the space for one to reach their own conclusions, which is
											    imperative for long term change. She is an empathic listener and encourages one to 
											    achieve their potential, facilitating removal of obstacles easily. Having known 
											    Prasanthi for a number of years, I am aware of her compassionate nature and her belief 
											    in the uniqueness of each person. As such, her clients can only benefit." - Alka D </p>
											    <p> "I found my coaching sessions with Prasanthi very positive and enjoyable. She 
											    helped to keep me focused on what I wanted to achieve in each session and ultimately
											    on my end goal... She recognised that I can over commit, which then leads to doing a 
											    lot less and feeling faliure so she constantly challenged my commitment... I now have
											    my action plan written down and I regularly refer back to it to check in how I am
											    progressing ans succeeding... Thank you for your help, patience and laughter." - Mariam V</p>
											    <p>"Coaching helped me to understand my situation, get clarification about what I want
											    to do, the things that are important to me, and what really matters... Prasanthi Matharu is
											    a very skilled coach who has helped me achieve my goals." - Tirath S</p>
											    <p>"Working with Prasanthi made me realise the importance of prioritising and...
											    having more structure in managing my time. She is very professional. I liked how she asked
											    me really powerful and challenging questions that made me think and see my situation from
											    another perspective showing me what I can do to overcome any potential obstacle... In every
											    session she made me feel at ease and safe to open up and talk about any subject. Thanks to
											    working with her I have increased my awareness of what I really want in my life." - Deborah O</span></p>
